              <p>Many people don't enjoy the haggling process. It's not as commonplace in the UK as in other countries, and can be quite daunting for the uninitiated. But there is money to be saved if you have the skills to drive the best deal, and The Negotiator can help.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col s12"><p>The Negotiator knows what you want. To pay less for your house or car, or to claim as much as possible from a complaint. And he can help.</p>
            <p>Vastly experienced, The Negotiator has his own businesses but saw an opportunity to use his skills to help others (and to make money himself!). He's put together a crack team of experts in key industries to make sure you always get the best result.</p>
            <p>It's very simple. For example let's say you want to buy a house at £200k. If The Negotiator can agree the sale at £190k you split the difference 50/50. In this case you save £5k and The Negotiator earns a £5k fee. The better deal he can get the more you save and the more he makes, so there is always an incentive for him to drive the best possible deal.</p>
            <p>If he cannot secure a saving there is nothing to pay. <b>No win. No fee. No risk</b>.</p>
            <p>The Negotiator has done deals on residential and commercial property, vehicles, claims and much more. He's in demand and can't take on every enquiry so to find out if he can help you <a href="#contact">contact him</a> today.</p>

            <h3>Property</h3>
            <p>Your home is the usually biggest and most expensive purchase you'll ever make, so it's prime territory for The Negotiator. Even a small percentage reduction in price can mean thousands extra in your pocket for refurbishments, redecoration or even a big house-warming party!</p>
            <p>Remember, it's <b>no win, no fee</b>. If The Negotiator takes on the challenge and can't beat your price you pay nothing.</p>

            <h3>Cars</h3>
            <p>Buying a new car? Or a used car? Cars are usually our second biggest purchase, and so ripe for making big savings. Lots of people dread the car salesman and the haggling, and because of that they end up paying more than they need to.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a cash buyer or seeking the best finance deal The Negotiator can help you, so take the stress out of the process and <a href="#contact">contact The Negotiator</a> today.</p>

            <h3>Claims or Complaints</h3>
            <p>Ever been fobbed off by a company you've not been happy with? Or been offered a token amount of compensation which doesn't match your distress and inconvenience?</p>
            <p>If you have a genuine complaint, claim or grievance and feel you are being treated unfairly contact The Negotiator. Companies take him seriously, so seriously many of his clients are now free of stress and thousands of pounds better off. And again, it's <b>no win, no fee</b>, so you have nothing to lose!</p>

I got The Negotiator involved and they <span class="focus">increased their offer to £2250</span>. It took a few weeks but the extra £1500 was more than worth it! I'd recommend The Negotiator to anyone.</p>

I called The Negotiator and two weeks later they settled for £185k. After The Negotiator's fee I walked away <span class="focus">£3.5k better off</span>. The house is perfect, and getting it cheaper was the icing on the cake. Thanks to The Negotiator.</p>
